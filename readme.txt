== Frequently Asked Questions ==

How do I extend Debug This?

= PHP =

New debug modes can be created easily:
`add_debug_extension($mode, $menu_label, $description, $callback, $group = 'General');`

**Example**

`
add_debug_extension(
	//Mode
	'actions',
	//Menu Label
	__('Actions', 'debug-this'),
	//Description
	__('$wp_actions contains all active registered actions', 'debug-this'),
	//Callback (accepts object methods)
	'foo_callback',
	//Admin Bar Menu Group - default == 'General'
	'Filters And Actions'
);
function foo_callback($buffer, $template){
	global $wp_actions;
	$debug = print_r($wp_actions, true);
	return $debug;
}
`
Extensions can be removed as well.
`remove_debug_extension($mode);`

You can also hook into the 'debug-this' WordPress hook:

`add_action('debug_this', 'foo_callback');
function foo_callback($mode){
	//Do Something
}
`

= JavaScript =

The `debugThis` object is defined for easy access the current mode, default mode, template file name, and defined debug query var.

There are two functions available:
* `isDebug()`
* `getDebugMode()` - uses isDebug()

A jQuery hook is also available:
`
jQuery(document).bind('debug-this', function(event, debugThis){
	console.log(debugThis);
});
`

To use these functions enqueue your script with 'debug-this' as your dependency. Your script will inherit a jQuery dependency.
